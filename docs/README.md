# Auxiliary documentation for Project GenoMac generally

This GenoMac-shared/docs directory collects documentation that applies to the entire Project GenoMac,
and thus is not appropriately assigned specifically to either GenoMac-system or GenoMac-user.

See:
- “[The two types of operations in Project GenoMac and their corresponding families of states](https://github.com/jimratliff/GenoMac-shared/blob/main/docs/States_migration_operations.md)”
